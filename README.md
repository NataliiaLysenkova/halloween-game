Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this Halloween-themed game presents users with a randomly selected Trick or Treat page each time they click the "Play" button on the main screen. 
Each Trick or Treat page is dynamically generated upon selection, offering a unique experience with every interaction, and includes a Play button to return users to the main page.

The Treat page features a canvas animation activated by clicking on the central image on the page.

The Trick page loads a different random image at the bottom each time it is visited.

All three pages include different animations to increase user engagement and visual appeal.
